            <p> 莲&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp花&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp开&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp放&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp的&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp那&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp天<br><br><br>
                唉&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp我&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp不&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp自&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp觉&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp地&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp心&nbsp&nbsp魂&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp飘&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp荡。<br><br><br>
                我&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp的&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp花&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp篮&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp空&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp着&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp花&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp儿&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp我&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp也&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp没&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp有&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp去&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp理&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp睬。<br><br><br>
                不&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp时&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp地&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp有&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp段&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp的&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp幽&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp愁&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp来&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp袭&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp击&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp我。<br><br><br>
                我&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp从&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp梦&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp中&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp惊&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp起<br><br><br>
                觉&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp得&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp南&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp风&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp里&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp有&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp一&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp阵&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp奇&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp香&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp的&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp芳&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp踪。<br><br><br>
                这&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp迷&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp茫&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp的&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp温&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp馨&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp使&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp我&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp想&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp望&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp得&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp心&nbsp&nbsp痛<br><br><br>
                我&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp觉&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp得&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp这&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp仿&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp佛&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp是&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp夏&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp天&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp渴&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp望&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp的&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp气&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp息&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp寻&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp求&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp圆&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp满。</p>
